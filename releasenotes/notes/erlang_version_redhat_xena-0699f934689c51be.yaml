upgrade:
  - |
    Erlang version is changed from ``24.1-1`` to ``24.1.3-1``. Depending on
    when deployment was done, that could be different minor releases. This
    means that your erlang version might be either minorly upgraded or
    downgraded. This should not lead to incompatabilities with RabbitMQ
    in any scenario.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed Erlang installation from Cloudsmith repository for CentOS 8 Stream
    by adjusting version that will be installed.
  - |
    Erlang version is now synced between Ubuntu/Debian and CentOS 8 Stream.
