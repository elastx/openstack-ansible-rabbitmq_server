    Under Extended Maintenance RabbitMQ version was bumped to 3.8.30 which is
    higher version then used on V or W releases. This only affects users who
    track stable/ussuri branch instead of being on specific tags.
    RabbitMQ version is now downggraded from 3.8.30 to 3.8.14. If you have
    already upgraded to newer RabbitMQ version we suggest defining
    ``rabbitmq_package_version: 3.8.30-1`` in your user_variables and keep
    that for Victoria and Wallaby releases.
